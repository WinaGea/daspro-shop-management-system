# 🏪 Daspro – Shop Management System (Toko U.D. Antony)

This repository contains a **Shop Management System** developed in **C language** as the final project for the *Programming Fundamentals (Dasar Pemrograman)* course at **Institut Teknologi Del**.  
The system helps a small local store, **Toko U.D. Antony**, manage its stock, sales transactions, and reports efficiently through a simple console-based interface.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview
The Shop Management System (SMS) provides basic store management functionalities such as adding new products, recording transactions, viewing reports, and maintaining persistent data storage using text files.  
It demonstrates essential C programming concepts including **loops**, **conditional statements**, **arrays**, **structures**, and **file handling**.

All store data is saved to a text file (`proyek.txt`), ensuring it remains available even after the program is closed.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Apply fundamental programming logic using **C language**
- Build a real-world console application with user interaction
- Implement **file handling** for data persistence
- Practice **modular programming** with functions
- Generate and analyze store sales reports
